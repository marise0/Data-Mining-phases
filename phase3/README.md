# phase3

This phase builds upon the previous work by applying advanced clustering techniques (K-means and Hierarchical Clustering) and classification methods (Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forest, and Boosting) to predict patient care categories ("in care" or "out care") using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from a private hospital in Indonesia.

## üîë Key Steps and Findings  

### üîç Data Preprocessing and Cleaning  
- **Outlier Removal**: Outliers were identified and removed using boxplots for each numerical feature. The dataset was reduced from 4412 to 3694 observations (718 outliers removed).  
- **Standardization**: Data was standardized to ensure compatibility with PCA and clustering algorithms.  

### üå≥ Classification Techniques  
#### Decision Tree  
- **Accuracy**: 74.37%  
- **Key Splits**: THROMBOCYTE, ERYTHROCYTE, and LEUCOCYTE were the most important predictors.  
- **Rules**:  
  - If THROMBOCYTE < 151 ‚Üí Predict "in care."  
  - If THROMBOCYTE ‚â• 151 and ERYTHROCYTE < 4.1 ‚Üí Further split by LEUCOCYTE.

#### Bagging (Random Forest with m = p)  
- **Accuracy**: 76.62%  
- **OOB Error**: 24.21%  
- **Important Variables**: THROMBOCYTE, AGE, LEUCOCYTE.  

#### Random Forest (m = ‚àöp)  
- **Accuracy**: 75.81%  
- **OOB Error**: 24.48%  
- **Important Variables**: THROMBOCYTE, LEUCOCYTE, AGE.  

#### Boosting (XGBoost)  
- **Accuracy**: 77.44% (highest among all methods)  
- **Key Parameters**: 50 trees, max depth = 3.  
- **Important Variables**: THROMBOCYTE, LEUCOCYTE, ERYTHROCYTE.

### üéØ Clustering Techniques  
#### K-means Clustering  
- **Optimal Clusters**: The elbow method suggested **k=3** as the optimal number of clusters.

- **Patient Distribution**: Out-care patients dominated Clusters 1 and 3, while in-care patients were slightly more prevalent in Cluster 2.

#### Hierarchical Clustering  
- **Linkage Methods**: Compared single, average, and complete linkage. Complete linkage produced the most balanced dendrogram.

</p>

- **Optimal Cut**: The dendrogram was cut into **2 clusters** at height=10.8.

- **Patient Distribution**: Out-care patients outnumbered in-care patients in both clusters, indicating limited separation by care type.

:warning: Neither K-means nor hierarchical clustering effectively separated in-care and out-care patients, suggesting these methods may not be ideal for this task.  


### üìä Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
- **Variance Explained**: The first two principal components explained ~88% of the total variance.
-

- **Key Correlations**:  
  - "ERYTHROCYTE," "HAEMOGLOBINS," and "HAEMATOCRIT" were closely correlated.  
  - "MCV" and "MCH" also showed a directional trend.

- **Biplot Visualization**: Highlighted the contribution of each variable to the principal components.

### üìã Summary of Results  
| Method               | Accuracy | Top Predictors                     |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| Decision Tree        | 74.37%   | THROMBOCYTE, ERYTHROCYTE, LEUCOCYTE |
| Bagging              | 76.62%   | THROMBOCYTE, AGE, LEUCOCYTE         |
| Random Forest        | 75.81%   | THROMBOCYTE, LEUCOCYTE, AGE         |
| Boosting (XGBoost)   | 77.44%   | THROMBOCYTE, LEUCOCYTE, ERYTHROCYTE |

### üîë Key Insights  

- **Classification**: Boosting (XGBoost) achieved the highest accuracy (77.44%). THROMBOCYTE was consistently the most important predictor across all methods.  
- **Variable Importance**: The ranking of predictors was similar in bagging, random forest, and boosting, but differed from the decision tree.
