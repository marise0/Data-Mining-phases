# Data Mining phases
## This repo contains a data mining project divided into :three: phases

:scroll: The general guidelines for each phase are displayed here, and more information is provided in the `README` within each phase.

### \:file\_folder: phase1

:white_check_mark: Dataset Selection: Selected a dataset with a **quantitative** response variable to work with, avoiding overlap with existing solutions available.

\:mag: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

\:bar\_chart: Visualization & Exploration:  Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).

\:chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: Linear Regression: Applied linear regression techniques.

\:bulb: Hypotheses for Further Exploration: From the initial exploration, furher hypotheses were proposed.

### \:file\_folder: phase2

:white_check_mark: Dataset Selection: Chose a dataset with a quantitative response variable, ensuring it is original and not derived from any existing online solutions.

:scissors:Subset Selection: Applied various subset selection approaches using different evaluation measures (Cp, BIC, adjusted RÂ²).

\:chart\_with\_upwards\_trend: Classification Techniques: Performed Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA).

:repeat: Resampling Techniques: Used resampling methods (e.g., cross-validation) and compared the performance of the classifiers.
